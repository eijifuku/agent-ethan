# Agent Ethan Product Guide

Agent Ethan compiles YAML agent graphs into an executable runtime. It supports JsonLogic routers, looping constructs, tool integrations, and LangChain adapters for conversation memory and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

Key capabilities:
- Declarative YAML graphs that orchestrate LLM and tool nodes.
- Built-in adapters for OpenAI-compatible APIs such as LM Studio.
- Optional LangChain bridges for conversational memory and vector-store backed retrieval.
